# Web-Scrapping-Practice
For my job, I was tasked with matching park names with their zipcode and district. I tried a few ways of doing this through a combination of web scrapping and geographical packages. I did not have a bunch of luck, but I thought it would be good to share as a work in progress and incase anybody would like to build off it!
